# Introducing Interactions


We now introduce another class `Interaction`.

The following will be the fields and methods of this class
```java
private HashSet<PathwayElement> source = new HashSet<>();
private HashSet<PathwayElement> target = new HashSet<>();

public void addSource(PathwayElement pathwayElement){
    source.add(pathwayElement);
}

public void addTarget(PathwayElement pathwayElement){
    target.add(pathwayElement);
}

public HashSet<PathwayElement> getSource(){
    return source;
}

public HashSet<PathwayElement> getTarget(){
    return target;
}
```
* The fields for the `Interaction` class are self-explanatory.
* `Interaction` stores a set of `source`, all DataNodes acting as source in the `Interaction` and `target` for all target DataNodes.

Also every `PathwayElement` will have following additional fields
```java
	private HashSet<Interaction> sourceInteractions = new HashSet<>(); // Only valid for PathwayElement of type DATANODE
	private HashSet<Interaction> targetInteractions = new HashSet<>(); // Only valid for PathwayElement of type DATANODE
	private Interaction lineInteraction; // Only valid for PathwayElement of type LINE
```

* Each DataNode has a set of `sourceInteractions` and `targetInteractions`
    * They both store the interaction in which the current DataNode acts as a source or a target respectively.
* Each Line has a field `lineInteraction` which refers to the interaction that line is a part of, since a line can only belong to at max one Interaction.


## Some test cases

![myimage.name](/assets/basic1.png)

Here we have a simple interaction between two nodes.

![myimage.name](/assets/basic2.png)

This is an extension of Basic 1, adding another target to the interaction.

![myimage.name](/assets/basic3.png)

This is an extension of Basic 1, adding instead a source to the interaction.

![myimage.name](/assets/basic4.png)

This is a mix of Basic 1 and Basic 2 with both multiple sources and targets.
