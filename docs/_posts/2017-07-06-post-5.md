# Introducing Interactions



We now introduce another class `Interaction`.

The following will be the fields and methods of this class
```java
private HashSet<PathwayElement> source = new HashSet<>();
private HashSet<PathwayElement> target = new HashSet<>();

public void addSource(PathwayElement pathwayElement){
    source.add(pathwayElement);
}

public void addTarget(PathwayElement pathwayElement){
    target.add(pathwayElement);
}

public HashSet<PathwayElement> getSource(){
    return source;
}

public HashSet<PathwayElement> getTarget(){
    return target;
}
```
* The fields for the `Interaction` class are self-explanatory.
* `Interaction` stores a set of `source`, all DataNodes acting as source in the `Interaction` and `target` for all target DataNodes.

Also every `PathwayElement` will have following additional fields
```java
	private HashSet<Interaction> sourceInteractions = new HashSet<>(); // Only valid for PathwayElement of type DATANODE
	private HashSet<Interaction> targetInteractions = new HashSet<>(); // Only valid for PathwayElement of type DATANODE
	private Interaction lineInteraction; // Only valid for PathwayElement of type LINE
```

* Each DataNode has a set of `sourceInteractions` and `targetInteractions`
    * They both store the interaction in which the current DataNode acts as a source or a target respectively.
* Each Line has a field `lineInteraction` which refers to the interaction that line is a part of, since a line can only belong to at max one Interaction.
* All interactions are also stored in the root Pathway as `	private HashSet<Interaction> interactions`

## Some test cases

![myimage.name](/assets/basic1.png)

Here we have a simple interaction between two nodes.

![myimage.name](/assets/basic2.png)

This is an extension of Basic 1, adding another target to the interaction.

![myimage.name](/assets/basic3.png)

This is an extension of Basic 1, adding instead a source to the interaction.

![myimage.name](/assets/basic4.png)

This is a mix of Basic 2 and Basic 3 with both multiple sources and targets.

## How Interactions are added

* To add any interaction, we usually need to create a `line` and connect it with two DataNodes or a DataNode and an Anchor.
* After making the connections, we can call the method `line.updateInteractions()`.
* The method will create an Interactions and update all the invariants i.e the set `sourceInteractions`, `targetInteractions` for both ends and `lineInteraction` for the line, add the new Interaction to the Pathway.
[`updateInteractions()`](#updateinteractions)

#### Assumptions

* Note that in the method `updateInteractions()` we only update for three cases.
* A line can be a part of an `Interaction` only if one its end is connected to a DataNode.


### More work?

* Currently this method can only build `Interactions`, kind of like blockchains
* A vague comparison but how it works is if you have to analyze any pathway.
    * First step would be create/load the pathway 
    * Call the method updateInteractions 
    * Use the interactions
* The drawback being Interactions cannot be edited, though technically it still can be done by clearing all Interactions then updating them again.
* The current method is robust and easy to test since it has little assumptions, i.e. it starts with nothing then builds all the interactions.

Let us look at some more test cases.

![myimage.name](/assets/chain1.png)

Here we have two simple interactions.

Three interactions

Chained Interactions with multiple sources, targets

### Anamoly

![myimage.name](/assets/complex1.png)

* These kind of interactions is why the method updateInteractions() looks a lot more complicated than it could.
* The anamoly in this case is that GeneProduct4 is not connected to a parent Interaction line i.e. a line connecting two DataNodes, which happened consistently in all other cases.
* This can still logically be qualified as an Interaction with Datanodes 1,3,4 as sources and 2,5 as targets.
* This Interaction with the current method would be parsed as a single Interaction.

## updateInteractions

```java
public void updateInteractions() {
    Pathway p = getPathway();
    if(p==null) return;
    GraphIdContainer source = p.getGraphIdContainer(getMStart().getGraphRef());

            temp = target, anchorT=null;
    PathwayElement sourceElement = null, targetElement = null;
    // If the line has no valid references to source and target containers,
    // It is not connected and could not be a valid Interaction
    if(source==null||target==null) return;

    // Check if source or target are PathwayELement DataNode or MAnchors
    if(source instanceof PathwayElement)
        sourceElement = (PathwayElement)source;

    if(target instanceof PathwayElement)
        targetElement = (PathwayElement)target;

    if(source instanceof MAnchor) anchorT = source;
    if(target instanceof MAnchor) anchorT = target;

    Interaction interaction = lineInteraction;

    // True if the line has a direct connection to both source and target
    if (sourceElement!=null && sourceElement.getObjectType()==ObjectType.DATANODE

        }
    }
    else if(sourceElement!=null&&sourceElement.getObjectType()==ObjectType.DATANODE){

        }

            }
        }
    }
    // Same as for source
    else if(targetElement!=null&&targetElement.getObjectType()==ObjectType.DATANODE){
        while(source instanceof MAnchor){

            }
        }
    }
    // Invalid Interaction, one of the ends need to be connected to a DataNode
    else
        return;
    // Update all structures
    // Also note since they are HashSets, duplicates are implicitly checked
    if(interaction==null||sourceElement==null||targetElement==null) return;
