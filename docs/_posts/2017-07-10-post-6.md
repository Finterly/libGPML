# Introducing Interactions (Updated)



We now introduce another module `org.pathvisio.network`.

The following will be the fields and methods of the main class `PathwayAsNetwork`
```java
    // constructor, creates a network model using a pathway
    public PathwayAsNetwork(Pathway pathway);

    // get method for the pathway
    public Pathway getPathway();

    // get method for all Edges (Interactions)
    public HashSet<Edge> getEdges();

    // get method for the Edge any MLine is a part of
    public HashMap<PathwayElement, Edge> getLineEdges();

    // get the map for Xref to Node
    public HashMap<Xref, Node> getNodes();

```

further for `Node` class we have

```java
    // Add more dataNodes with identical Xrefs to the node 
    public void add(PathwayElement pathwayElement);
    
    // get method for the set of dataNodes with the node object
    public HashSet<PathwayElement> getDataNodes();
```

and finally the `Edge` class (alias for Interactions)

```java
    // Add another source to the Edge
    public void addSource(Node node);

    // Add another target to the Edge
    public void addTarget(Node node);

    // Get all source nodes
    public HashSet<Node> getSources();
    
    // Get all target nodes
    public HashSet<Node> getTargets();
    
    /**
    * Get the union of source and target nodes
    * used when no arrowhead attached with the line
    * i.e. edgeType is LineType.LINE
    */
    public HashSet<Node> getParticipants();
    
    // getter for edgeType
    public LineType getEdgeType();
```

## Some test cases

![myimage.name](/assets/basic1.png)

Here we have a simple interaction between two nodes.

![myimage.name](/assets/basic2.png)

This is an extension of Basic 1, adding another target to the interaction.

![myimage.name](/assets/basic31.png)

This is an extension of Basic 1, adding instead a source to the interaction.

![myimage.name](/assets/basic41.png)

This is a mix of Basic 2 and Basic 3 with both multiple sources and targets.

![myimage.name](/assets/chain1.png)

Here we have two simple interactions.

![myimage.name](/assets/chain2.png)

Three interactions

Chained Interactions with multiple sources, targets

### Special Case

![myimage.name](/assets/complex11.png)

* This case is special because here we don't have any line that can act as 
the parent line, i.e. both of its ends are connected to a dataNode.
* Here 4 dataNodes are connected to a line whose both ends are not 
connected to anything.
* In other cases when one end of a line is connected to a dataNode, other to an anchor,
 the parent of the anchor was always connected to a dataNode on both ends.
* The current workaround to detect this case is 
    * While checking if for the parent of the anchor, if the line isn't connected to 
    any dataNode but has another anchor and another line which is connected to that 
    anchor. 
    * We use any dataNode connected to that line as a connected node.
    * Perhaps the code will make it more clear

```java
    /**
     * get any other line connected to the current anchor's line through another anchor
     * @param anchorT
     * @return
     */
    private PathwayElement getConnectedLine(MAnchor anchorT){
        MAnchor otherAnchor = null;
        PathwayElement otherLine = null;
        // find any other anchor
        for(MAnchor anchor:anchorT.getParent().getMAnchors())
            if(anchor!=anchorT){
                otherAnchor=anchor;
                break;
            }
        if(otherAnchor!=null){
            // search for all lines connected to that anchor
            for(PathwayElement pline:lines){
                if(pline.getMEnd().getGraphRef().equals(otherAnchor.getGraphId())
                        ||pline.getMStart().getGraphRef().equals(otherAnchor.getGraphId())) {
                    otherLine = pline;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return otherLine;
    }
    
```
