# GPML 2013a Schema

This article is dedicated to to getting the gist of the GPML schema. So lets try to understand what the GPML 2013a schema is all about and why it is what it is. 

*GPML is simply an XML-based format. You can use it to define a pathway consisting of purely graphical elements (such as lines and shapes) or graphical elements with added biological information (such as genes, proteins and interactions) GPML has very strong ties to the GenMAPP MAPP format. This is important to realize because it explains some of the idiosyncrasies in the definition that are usually there for backwards compatibility to GenMAPP.*[[source]](https://www.pathvisio.org/gpml/)
 
You should give the source a read for a basic idea of the GPML schema, I'll use a different approach and go through the whole schema code.
