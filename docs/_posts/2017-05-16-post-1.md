# Hello World


Hey fellow humans and crawlers

I am a Computer Science and Technology major at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, class of 2018.

I love skateboarding; an avid reader, mostly fantasy though and obviously a neophyte blogger. Really love the works of Andrzej Sapkowski, Patrick Rothfuss, Alan Moore.
