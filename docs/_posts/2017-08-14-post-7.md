# BioPAX Exporter



We now introduce another module `org.pathvisio.core.exporter`.

Currently the module supports export to BioPAX (owl) format used extensively by the community to exchange pathway data.

This module uses the [Biopax Exporter plugin](https://github.com/PathVisio/biopax-plugin/tree/master/src/org/pathvisio/biopax3) with improvements to get around the errors/warnings given by the [BioPAX validator](https://github.com/BioPAX/validator).

Let us discuss the changes step by step using an example.

* The main problem which was faced while converting GPML to BioPAX representation of pathways was the lack of Xref IDs.
* The BioPAX format has the Xref mandatory.
* The example we are using also suffers with the same problem.

# ERROR: no.xrefs
_EntityReference does not have any xrefs_

The workaround adopted for this problem was to just ignore any data nodes without any valid Xref ID. 
But this lead to another warning as should be clear from the image.

## Warning: dangling.elements

* The solution of this problem we used was to now remove any such data nodes which are not a part of any reaction.
* Here org.pathvisio.core.network module comes in handy.
* PathwayAsNetwork class creates a network model for the data nodes using their Xref ID.
* Any elements which do not have valid Xref are inherently ignored
* We can then traverse through all interactions and remove any such data nodes which are not a part of any interaction

This is the final pathway which would be converted to BioPAX without any errors.

* Even after all this we still get some warnings like
* ##### WARNING: too.long.display.name
_'displayName' exceeds the recommended maximum. These names should be kept short so they can easily be displayed, e.g., in a pathway diagram_
* This is a minor warning
* Could be solved just by using the first 25 characters of the Pathway display name
* ##### WARNING: denied.xref  
_Database value of the UnificationXref (of a BioPAX element) does not apply (prohibited) for this type of element_
