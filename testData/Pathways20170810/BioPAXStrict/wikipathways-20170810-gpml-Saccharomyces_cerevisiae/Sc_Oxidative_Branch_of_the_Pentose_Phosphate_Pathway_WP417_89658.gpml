 <bp:comment rdf:datatype = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The reactions of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway occur in the cytosol and are important for generating NADPH through the oxidative reduction of NADP+. NADPH is an important source of the reducing energy required by many enzymes in central biosynthetic pathways  (CITS:[8929392]) (CITS:[8910528]) (CITS:[9813062]) (CITS:[11298766]) (CITS:[1628611]). Although there are other biochemical pathways that generate NADPH in yeast, the pentose phosphate pathway is considered the major source of NADPH, and insufficient NADPH probably contributes to  the fitness defects seen in mutants of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (CITS:[12047390]) (CITS:[15960801]). Because NADPH is an essential  cofactor for glutathione- and thioredoxin-dependent enzymes that  defend cells against oxidative damage,  the oxidative branch of the  pentose phosphate pathway is also important for protecting yeast from  oxidative stress (CITS:[8929392])(CITS:[8910528])(CITS:[11557322])(CITS:[16179340]).   Metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway varies according to the metabolic needs of the cell (CITS:[10803891]) (CITS:[15066826]). The first reaction of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway is irreversible, and is the rate limiting reaction for the entire pentose phosphate pathway (CITS:[12047390]). Although Zwf1p expression in yeast is essentially constitutive (CITS:[16179340]), Zwf1p activity is inhibited by NADPH and stimulated by processes that decrease the cytosolic levels of NADPH (CITS:[ 3277619]).
