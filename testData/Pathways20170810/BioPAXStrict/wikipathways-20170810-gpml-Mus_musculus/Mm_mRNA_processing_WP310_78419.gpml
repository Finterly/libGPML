This process describes the conversion of precursor messenger RNA into mature messenger RNA (mRNA). The pre-mRNA molecule undergoes three main modifications. These modifications are 5&apos; capping, 3&apos; polyadenylation, and RNA splicing, which occur in the cell nucleus before the RNA is translated.

5&apos; Capping: Capping of the pre-mRNA involves the addition of 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5&apos; end. The cap protects the 5&apos; end of the primary RNA transcript from attack by ribonucleases that have specificity to the 3&apos;5&apos; phosphodiester bonds.

3&apos; Processing: The pre-mRNA processing at the 3&apos; end of the RNA molecule involves cleavage of its 3&apos; end and then the addition of about 200 adenine residues to form a poly(A) tail. As the poly(A) tails is synthesised, it binds multiple copies of poly(A) binding protein, which protects the 3&apos;end from ribonuclease digestion.

Splicing: RNA splicing is the process by which introns, regions of RNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule.
